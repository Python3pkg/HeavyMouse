#HeavyMouse

This is a silly program, designed to give your mouse momemtum, gravity and wrap/bounce at the screens edge.

Deps:

    pip install pymouse


To run:

    python heavymouse.py

or on py3:

    sudo apt-get install python-tk #is this needed? is it the right lib?
    pip3 install pyautogui
    python3 alternate_heavymouse.py
    
Sorry about the low update-rate on py3 - a PR to fix it would be very welcome ;)
